            <p>I love reading Harry Potter books whenever I get time. I have read all the books 8 to 9 times...
                After reading the books I feel like going to Hogwarts and practice magic spells.Take part in the sorting ceremony get sorted into houses!! I am eagerly waiting for my Hogwart Acceptance Letter (I know that I will not get it because its a fandom created by JK Rowling but still hoping!!) I thank her to create such a wonderful world for all of us...ðŸ¤— I have some Harry Potter magic for you all,to see the magic begin just press the spells that are below</p>
